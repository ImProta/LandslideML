# Landslide susceptibility map generation with ML modules

## Overview

'LandslideML' is a Python package designed to generate landslide susceptibility map using machine learning models present in the scikit-learn toolbox.
It is capable of:
- Reading Random Forest dataset
- Training and Validating ML models from scikit-learn
- Generating binary mapping for landslide susceptibility
- Plotting the binary data into a 2D map

## Features 

- Read and preprocess datasets for landslide susceptibility analysis.
- Train multiple machine learning models including SVM, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- Generate and save susceptibility maps.

## Installation 

To install the library, you can use the 'pip' command:

```bash
pip install LandslideML
```

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, which are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of the usage of the python package to train the ML model ... and generate a susceptibility map ...
